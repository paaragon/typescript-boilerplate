## Why use this proejct?

Build your typescript projects without worrying about boilerplate

## NPM Scripts

* `build`: transpile your TypeScript into JavaScript and place it in `dist` folder.
* `test`: execute your tests under `test` folder.
* `test:watch`: execute your tests like `npm test` and relaunch them every time you change them.
* `test:coverage`: execute your tests and generate the coverage report.
* `start`: run your transpiled JavaScript application (you need to run `npm run build` first).
* `start:dev`: run your application just from your TypeScript code without transpiling.
* `lint`: lint your TypeScript code under `src`.
* `lint:fix`: automatically fix your lint issues (when possible).
